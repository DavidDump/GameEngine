Rendering Engine:
    ✔ texture class - wrapper for OpenGL functions
    ✔ model class - store all data about one model
    ✔ renderer class
    ✔ lighting - ambient light, radiating single source, sunlight
    ☐ light class
    ✔ added model loader support for files that dont contain UVs and normals
    ☐ learn GLSL better
    ☐ GLSL syntax highlighting

Physics engine:
    ☐ GDK algorithm
    ☐ The other one that I forgot for collision detection
    ☐ some algorith to only check collisions between some objects for performace

Animation engine:   
    ☐ expand model loader to work with more file types
    ☐ add support for loading animation files
